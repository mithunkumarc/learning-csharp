> If derived class defines same method as defined in its base class, it is known as method overriding in C#. 
 
> It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. 

> It enables you to provide specific implementation of the method which is already provided by its base class.

> To perform method overriding in C#, you need to use virtual keyword with base class method and override keyword 
  with derived class method.

        }  
        
        output : use google code...      
        
          
#### if you override method without virtual and override keywordsd , it would be new method not a overrided one.
