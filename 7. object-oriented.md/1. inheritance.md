> Note: Multiple inheritance is not supported in C# through class.

#### when child obj created, its constructor calls parent constructor
#### because parent constructor knows all properties of parent class and initialized with default values
#### this is how child object takes helps of parent const to allocate memory for all prperties



#### along with state its value also inherited to child class

                using System;
                //class : type

                class Student{
                    public String name = "am student";
                }
                class Moniter : Student{

                }
                class Test{
                    static void Main(String[] args){
                            Student s = new Moniter();  //  Moniter s = new Moniter();
                            Console.WriteLine(s.name);  //  prints 'am student'
                    } 
                }




#### example :

        using System;  
        namespace classobjects  
        {         
            class Animal{
                public String name;
                public void eat(){
                    Console.WriteLine($"{this.name} eats");
                }
            }
            class Dog : Animal{

            }
            class Test  {                                                           
                static void Main(string[] args){        
                    Dog d = new Dog();
                    d.name = "tom";
                    d.eat();
                }     
            }  
        }          
        
        output : tom eats


#### composition  : one object is dependent on another. Eg: engine doesn't works(exists) outside car
                
                using System;  
                namespace classobjects  
                {         
                        class Engine{
                            public String name;
                        }
                        class Car{
                            public Engine engine = new Engine();                     
                        }
                        class Test  {                                                           
                            static void Main(string[] args){        
                                Car car = new Car();
                                car.engine.name = "DOHC v6";
                                Console.WriteLine($"engine of car is {car.engine.name}");
                            }     
                        }  
                }  
                
                
#### aggregation : two objects independent of each other. Eg : person and address(place) independent of each other.
            using System;  
            namespace classobjects  
            {         
                class Address{
                    public String cityName;
                }
                class Person{
                    public Address address;
                    public Person(Address address){
                        this.address = address;
                    } 
                }
                class Test  {                                                           
                    static void Main(string[] args){ 
                        //address exists outside person object also
                        Address address = new Address();
                        address.cityName = "bengaluru";       
                        Person person = new Person();                
                    }     
                }  
            }
