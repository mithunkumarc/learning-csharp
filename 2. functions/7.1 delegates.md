#### user defined delates : we have to declare with names
#### builtin delagate has no names , uses Func and Action

#### Func and Action are builtin delegates :

#### user defined delegates

> C# delegates are similar to pointers to functions, in C or C++. 
> A delegate is a reference type variable that holds the reference to a method. 
> The reference can be changed at runtime.

          using System;

          class Program
          {
              public delegate int square(int value);

              public delegate int add(int x, int y);
              static void Main(String[] args){           
                  square sq = (number) => number * number;
                  Console.WriteLine(sq(10));

                  add addition = (x,y) => x + y;
                  Console.WriteLine(addition(10,45));

              }
          }

#### passing function as paratmeter to function : higher order function

                    using System;
                    class Program
                    {
                        public delegate int square(int value);
                        public delegate int add(int x, int y);
                        static void Main(String[] args){           
                        square sq = (number) => number * number;
                        accepts_logic(sq);
                        }
                    public static void accepts_logic(square s){
                        Console.WriteLine(s(15));
                    }

                    }
